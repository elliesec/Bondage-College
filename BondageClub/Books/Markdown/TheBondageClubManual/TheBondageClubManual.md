## Introduction

[Back to the contents](#table-of-contents)

Congratulations! You've been accepted as an official member of the Bondage Club! The club is a big and often confusing place, and we know that sometimes it can be difficult for new members to learn their way around. But worry not! We have compiled this handy guide which (hopefully) covers everything you need to know about your Bondage Club membership!

**Note:** We're always looking to improve our new member experience. If you notice any mistakes in this manual, or think we've missed out some information about the club that should be here, please do get in touch with a member of the Bondage Club Development Team and let us know. The best way to report such issues is via [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/dkWsEjf), [DeviantArt](https://ben987.deviantart.com/) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/BondageProjects/).

Of course, we can't possibly document every tiny hidden secret about the club, and if you're a new member, we do encourage you to explore the club and discover what it can offer on your own initiative. But hopefully this guide will prove to be a useful reference for you throughout your time at the club.

Once again, welcome to the Bondage Club, and we hope you enjoy your membership!

## Your Club Account and Records

[Back to the contents](#table-of-contents)

Every member of the club receives their own club account which can be accessed via the club's intranet. Whilst browsing the club's pages, you will frequently see the following icon:

![Character Profile Icon](../../../Icons/Character.png)

Clicking this icon will take you to your personal club profile, where you will be able to see:

* Your club member name
* Your club member number
* Your club title (see [Club Titles](#club-titles))
* Your current account balance
* Your current difficulty mode (see [Difficulty Preferences](#difficulty-preferences))
* Details of your registered relationships (see [Relationships](#relationships))
* Your club reputations
* Your club skills

### Club Titles

[Back to the contents](#table-of-contents)

Club titles are a way to let other members know a little bit about you (as well as providing some of the more experienced members with bragging rights) - for example with titles like "Mistress", "Maid" or "Nurse". Titles are purely for show, but might help members know how you'd like to be addressed or how they should approach you.

As a new club member, your title options will be limited, but as you work on your skills and improve your reputation with the various club services (see [Skills and Reputation](#skills-and-reputation)), more titles will become available to you.

You can view or change your current title from your club profile page by clicking the following icon:

![Club Titles Icon](../../../Icons/Title.png)

Under certain circumstances, the club's systems may automatically change club members' titles. For example, registering yourself as a club slave will automatically give you the "Club Slave" title for the duration of your service. Similarly, when a patient escapes from the Asylum, their title will be changed to "Escaped Patient" in order to help Asylum nurses to identify and apprehend the patient.

### Skills and Reputation

[Back to the contents](#table-of-contents)

Aside from being fun, bondage and escape artistry can be art forms in their own right, and at the club we encourage members to learn and hone these skills. As your skills progress, we will continually assess them and they will be recorded on your user profile.

Similarly, the club contains a number of additional services and groups that cater to a wide variety of kinks. As you get involved in these various groups, your reputation in within them will change. As we get to know our club members, we will also get a better gauge of their dominance or submissiveness, and keep track of these in order to better serve your needs.

Your skills and reputations are tracked by the club's system, and you are able to view your current values on the second page of your member profile. You can switch pages in your profile using the "Next" button in the bottom right of your profile:

![Next Page Icon](../../../Icons/Next.png)

The next section goes into some details on the skills that we monitor at the club, and how you can improve them.

#### The Bondage Skill

The bondage skill is a measure of how good you are at binding people. As your bondage skill improves, bondage you apply to others will be more difficult to escape from, and you will become more capable of using more advanced bondage techniques, like hogties and suspension ties in the case of rope bondage.

There are two main ways of improving your bondage skill:

* Practising on other club members will slowly increase your skill
* The club's Shibari Dojo offers bondage lessons for a fee. They can be expensive, but training under our specialist instructors can often greatly improve your skills in a short time

#### The Evasion Skill

The evasion skill is a measure of how good you are at escaping bondage. As your evasion skill improves, bondage applied to you by others will become easier to escape. But be aware that even the best escape artists can be rendered helpless with strict enough restraints!

There are two main ways of improving your evasion skill:

* Successfully escaping from restraints will slowly increase your skill
* The club's Shibari Dojo also offers escape lessons for a fee

#### The Self-Bondage Skill

The self-bondage skill represents your skill at applying bondage to yourself. AS you improve your self-bondage, you will be able to bind yourself with a wider variety of items, and more advanced techniques will become available to you. Remember that it's often easier to bind yourself than it is to escape! If you ever find yourself stuck in bondage, the Maid Sorority offers a rescue service - just ring the bell in the main hall.

There are two main ways of improving your self-bondage skill:

* Successfully applying bondage to yourself will slowly increase your skill
* The club's Shibari Dojo also offers lessons to help you to safely and effectively bind yourself

#### The Willpower Skill

The willpower skill is a measure of your self-control. A higher willpower will allow you to resist orgasms for longer, and reduces the effectiveness of opponents' attacks on you during kidnapping battles.

There are two main ways to improve your willpower skill:

* Practising your kidnapping skills by participating in kidnapping battles
* Resisting orgasms will also provide a small boost to your willpower skill. The more orgasms you can resist before giving in, the greater the increase.

### Your club biography

[Back to the contents](#table-of-contents)

The club also offers you a place to write a little bit about yourself: your club biography. Members' biographies are publicly viewable, and intended to help members to get to know a bit about each other before engaging in play.

You don't need to fill out your biography, but we do encourage all members to fill them out if they get the chance. If you're not sure what to write in there - a summary of your kinks and limits is always a good starting point!

You can view and edit your biography from your member profile page, by clicking the following button:

![Biography Button Icon](../../../Icons/Introduction.png)

## Your preferences

[Back to the contents](#table-of-contents)

The Bondage Club prides itself on providing for each of its members' specific needs and kinks, and you can customize your club experience by filling out your member preferences forms, available to access by clicking this button in your member profile page:

![Preferences Icon](../../../Icons/Preference.png)

The forms are split into individual categories to make it easy for you to find and modify the preferences that you want. We know that form-filling can be boring, but we strongly encourage members to take the time to express their preferences, as this will allow us to tailor your Bondage Club experience to better suit your needs and kinks.

In this section, we will cover each of the preference categories in detail, and give you an overview of how each preference will affect your club experience.

### ![General Preferences Icon](../../../Icons/General.png) General Preferences

[Back to the contents](#table-of-contents)

The preferences on this page cover a variety of options to help you to customize your club experience.

#### Character label color

This determines the color in which your member name will appear beneath your character, as well as in chatroom logs. You can directly enter a hexadecimal color code (e.g. `#d81f1f` or `#86F`) or use the color picker tool by clicking this button:

![Color Picker Icon](../../../Icons/Color.png)

#### Item Permission

This is your global item permissions, and determines who in the club will be able to interact with you. The various options are hopefully fairly self-explanatory. Anyone not covered by these options will be unable to add, remove or modify items on you, change your clothes or initiate sexual activities with you. The available permission levels are:

| Permission Level | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Everyone, no exceptions | Any other club member may modify your clothes and items or initiate activities, even members on your blacklist  |
| Everyone, except blacklist | Any club member that is not on your blacklist may modify your clothes and items or initiate activities with you |
| Owner, Lover, whitelist & Dominants | Only your club members who have a more dominant reputation than you (at least 25 points higher than yours) or who are on your whitelist may modify your clothes and items or initiate activities with you, along with your owner and lover(s), if you have the |
| Owner, Lover and whitelist only | Only your owner, lover(s) or members on your whitelist may modify your clothes and items or initiate activities with you |
| Owner and Lover only | Only your owner and lover(s) may modify your clothes and items or initiate activities with you |
| Owner only | The only club member that may modify your clothes and items or initiate activities with you is your owner |

If you are unfamiliar with any of the terms above, please refer to the relevant sections of this book for further information:
* [Owner & Lover Relationships](#relationships)
* [Member lists, including your blacklist & whitelist](#member-lists)

#### Display all characters at maximum height

Checking this option will ignore character height differences when displaying characters, and all characters will appear at the same height.

#### Allow Safeword use

Unchecking this will disable your ability to use your safeword inside chatrooms (see [Your Safeword](#your-safeword) for details).

**Warning:** Disabling this preference will prevent you from being able to get out of potentially unwanted situations, including those caused by trolls and abusive club members. Be absolutely sure this is what you want before unchecking it.

#### Maids come automatically when restrained

The Maid Sorority monitors the main hall and will dispatch maids to rescue club members who have managed to get themselves stuck in bondage. However, if you uncheck this option, they will not immediately dispatch a maid when seeing you in trouble in the main hall.

Unchecking this option can save you the hassle of having your kinky activities disturbed by the maids, and saves the sorority from wasting time dispatching maids when they aren't needed. Note that even if you have unchecked this preference, you can still call a maid when you're in trouble by ringing the bell in the main hall, which looks something like this:

![Maid Service Icon](../../../Icons/ServiceBell.png)

#### Cannot enter single-player rooms when restrained

We know some of our club members enjoy feeling truly helpless, and whilst the club's staff strive to be as helpful as possible, this can sometimes take away from that feeling of helplessness. Therefore, selecting this option in your member preferences will bar you from entering most club rooms and getting help from club staff when you're bound. Instead, you'll have to rely on other club members by visiting [the chatrooms](#the-chatrooms) (the maid rescue service will still be available from the main hall however).

### ![Difficulty Preferences Icon](../../../Icons/Difficulty.png) Difficulty Preferences

[Back to the contents](#table-of-contents)

The Difficulty Preferences page gives club members a selection of preset experiences to choose from. Each difficulty preference encompasses a wide range of changes to your club experience. Some of the difficulty choices on this page will allow you to fine-tune your club experience in the other preference pages. However, the more intense difficulties will lock you into certain choices. 

Your choice of difficulty is not something to be taken lightly, so we encourage members to read the descriptions below and ensure they fully understand everything that a given difficulty entails before committing to it. Be aware that after changing difficulty, you may not be able to change back immediately (see [Changing Difficulties](#changing-difficulties)).

#### Roleplay Difficulty

Roleplay difficulty is intended for members that want a more relaxed Bondage Club experience. This mode will allow you to freely customize your club experience, and bypass certain restrictions (see [Restriction Preferences](#restriction-preferences)).

#### Regular Difficulty

Regular Difficulty is the default Bondage Club experience. Basic restrictions (see [Restriction Preferences](#restriction-preferences)) are enforced, but you are otherwise able to customize your club experience to your liking.

#### Hardcore Difficulty

Hardcore difficulty is for members that want a stricter Bondage Club experience. When you choose this difficulty:
* The Maid Sorority's rescue service will no longer release you
* Club staff in the various club rooms won't help you when you're bound - you'll have to rely on other members by visiting [the chatrooms](#the-chatrooms).
* You won't have access to [your safeword](#your-safeword) when in chatrooms

#### Extreme Difficulty

Extreme difficulty is for members that want the strictest Bondage Club experience possible. This difficulty includes all of the restrictions of [Hardcore difficulty](#hardcore-difficulty), and in addition:
* You cannot block the use of individual items with [item permissions](#item-permissions)
* If you have been [fully collared](#full-collaring), you will not be allowed to break your collar

#### Changing Difficulties

To encourage members to think carefully about their selection of difficulty, we have some restrictions in place around changing difficulty:
* The Roleplay and Regular difficulties may be selected at any time without restriction
* The Hardcore and Extreme difficulties are only available to members that have been with the club for at least 7 days
* You _may not_ switch to Hardcore or Extreme difficulty if you have changed your difficulty within the last 7 days

Remember that the length of time that you have had been in your current difficulty will be automatically tracked and recorded on your [club member profile](#your-club-account-and-records), and changing difficulty will reset this count.

### ![Restriction Preferences Icon](../../../Icons/Restriction.png) Restriction Preferences

[Back to the contents](#table-of-contents)

The Restriction Preferences section allows you to bypass some of the restrictions that are normally placed on you when inside the club. Generally, the club enforces these restrictions on all members, but members that have selected the [Roleplay Difficulty](#roleplay-difficulty) may disable the restrictions in this section for a more relaxed club experience.

#### Bypass the struggling mini-game

This will make struggling out of items much easier. Be aware that if an item would usually be inescapable for you (challenge rating 7 or higher), you will still be unable to escape it. However, items with a challenge rating of 6 or below will be trivial to escape.

#### Cannot be slowed down from leaving a room

Under some conditions (for example when wearing items like hobble skirts and some ankle restraints), you may be slowed down from leaving a chatroom. Selecting this preference will allow you to leave chatrooms immediately, regardless of whether you have been slowed down or not.

### ![Chat Preferences Icon](../../../Icons/Chat.png) Chat Preferences

[Back to the contents](#table-of-contents)

The Chat Preferences allow you to customize the way that you view chatrooms, and also to filter out certain types of chatroom message.

| Preference | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Color theme | Allows you to change the color theme for the chat log |
| Enter/Leave message style | Allows you to change the style of (or hide completely) chatroom messages that are triggered when another club member enters or leaves the chatroom |
| Display member numbers | Allows you to change how and if club member numbers are displayed next to chatroom messages |
| Display timestamps | Toggles whether or not timestamps will be displayed alongside chatroom messages |
| Color names\* | Toggles whether or not names should be colored (using the sender's [label color](#character-label-color)) |
| Color actions\* | Toggles whether or not action messages (like equipping/removing items) should be colored |
| Color emotes\* | Toggles whether or not [emotes](#chat-basics) should be colored |
| Show sexual activities & orgasms | Toggles whether or not sexual activities and orgasms should be displayed in the chat log |
| Show all automatic messages | If toggled off, automated messages (for example from automatic vibrator modes) will not be shown in the chat log unless they directly concern you |
| Preserve whitespace in messages | Determines whether multiple consecutive spaces should be truncated to a single space in the chat log |
| Color activities\* | Toggles whether or not sexual activities (e.g. spanking/cuddling/kissing) should be colored |

\* **Note:** Under certain circumstances (notably with certain sensory deprivation preferences) chatroom messages may not be colored regardless of your preferences here.
