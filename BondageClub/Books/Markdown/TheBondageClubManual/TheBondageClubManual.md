## Introduction

[Back to the contents](#table-of-contents)

Congratulations! You've been accepted as an official member of the Bondage Club! The club is a big and often confusing place, and we know that sometimes it can be difficult for new members to learn their way around. But worry not! We have compiled this handy guide which (hopefully) covers everything you need to know about your Bondage Club membership!

**Note:** We're always looking to improve our new member experience. If you notice any mistakes in this manual, or think we've missed out some information about the club that should be here, please do get in touch with a member of the Bondage Club Development Team and let us know. The best way to report such issues is via [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/dkWsEjf), [DeviantArt](https://ben987.deviantart.com/) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/BondageProjects/).

Of course, we can't possibly document every tiny hidden secret about the club, and if you're a new member, we do encourage you to explore the club and discover what it can offer on your own initiative. But hopefully this guide will prove to be a useful reference for you throughout your time at the club.

Once again, welcome to the Bondage Club, and we hope you enjoy your membership!

## Your Club Account and Records

[Back to the contents](#table-of-contents)

Every member of the club receives their own club account which can be accessed via the club's intranet. Whilst browsing the club's pages, you will frequently see the following icon:

![Character Profile Icon](../../../Icons/Character.png)

Clicking this icon will take you to your personal club profile, where you will be able to see:

* Your club member name
* Your club member number
* Your club title (see [Club Titles](#club-titles))
* Your current account balance
* Details of your registered relationships (see [Relationships](#relationships))
* Your club reputations
* Your club skills

### Club Titles

[Back to the contents](#table-of-contents)

Club titles are a way to let other members know a little bit about you (as well as providing some of the more experienced members with bragging rights) - for example with titles like "Mistress", "Maid" or "Nurse". Titles are purely for show, but might help members know how you'd like to be addressed or how they should approach you.

As a new club member, your title options will be limited, but as you work on your skills and improve your reputation with the various club services (see [Skills and Reputation](#skills-and-reputation)), more titles will become available to you.

You can view or change your current title from your club profile page by clicking the following icon:

![Club Titles Icon](../../../Icons/Title.png)

Under certain circumstances, the club's systems may automatically change club members' titles. For example, registering yourself as a club slave will automatically give you the "Club Slave" title for the duration of your service. Similarly, when a patient escapes from the Asylum, their title will be changed to "Escaped Patient" in order to help Asylum nurses to identify and apprehend the patient.

### Skills and Reputation

[Back to the contents](#table-of-contents)

Aside from being fun, bondage and escape artistry can be art forms in their own right, and at the club we encourage members to learn and hone these skills. As your skills progress, we will continually assess them and they will be recorded on your user profile.

Similarly, the club contains a number of additional services and groups that cater to a wide variety of kinks. As you get involved in these various groups, your reputation in within them will change. As we get to know our club members, we will also get a better gauge of their dominance or submissiveness, and keep track of these in order to better serve your needs.

Your skills and reputations are tracked by the club's system, and you are able to view your current values on the second page of your member profile. You can switch pages in your profile using the "Next" button in the bottom right of your profile:

![Next Page Icon](../../../Icons/Next.png)

The next section goes into some details on the skills that we monitor at the club, and how you can improve them.

#### The Bondage Skill

The bondage skill is a measure of how good you are at binding people. As your bondage skill improves, bondage you apply to others will be more difficult to escape from, and you will become more capable of using more advanced bondage techniques, like hogties and suspension ties in the case of rope bondage.

There are two main ways of improving your bondage skill:

* Practising on other club members will slowly increase your skill
* The club's Shibari Dojo offers bondage lessons for a fee. They can be expensive, but training under our specialist instructors can often greatly improve your skills in a short time

#### The Evasion Skill

The evasion skill is a measure of how good you are at escaping bondage. As your evasion skill improves, bondage applied to you by others will become easier to escape. But be aware that even the best escape artists can be rendered helpless with strict enough restraints!

There are two main ways of improving your evasion skill:

* Successfully escaping from restraints will slowly increase your skill
* The club's Shibari Dojo also offers escape lessons for a fee

#### The Self-Bondage Skill

The self-bondage skill represents your skill at applying bondage to yourself. AS you improve your self-bondage, you will be able to bind yourself with a wider variety of items, and more advanced techniques will become available to you. Remember that it's often easier to bind yourself than it is to escape! If you ever find yourself stuck in bondage, the Maid Sorority offers a rescue service - just ring the bell in the main hall.

There are two main ways of improving your self-bondage skill:

* Successfully applying bondage to yourself will slowly increase your skill
* The club's Shibari Dojo also offers lessons to help you to safely and effectively bind yourself

#### The Willpower Skill

The willpower skill is a measure of your self-control. A higher willpower will allow you to resist orgasms for longer, and reduces the effectiveness of opponents' attacks on you during kidnapping battles.

There are two main ways to improve your willpower skill:

* Practising your kidnapping skills by participating in kidnapping battles
* Resisting orgasms will also provide a small boost to your willpower skill. The more orgasms you can resist before giving in, the greater the increase.

### Your club biography

[Back to the contents](#table-of-contents)

The club also offers you a place to write a little bit about yourself: your club biography. Members' biographies are publicly viewable, and intended to help members to get to know a bit about each other before engaging in play.

You don't need to fill out your biography, but we do encourage all members to fill them out if they get the chance. If you're not sure what to write in there - a summary of your kinks and limits is always a good starting point!

You can view and edit your biography from your member profile page, by clicking the following button:

![Biography Button Icon](../../../Icons/Introduction.png)

## Your preferences

[Back to the contents](#table-of-contents)

The Bondage Club prides itself on providing for each of its members' specific needs and kinks, and you can customize your club experience by filling out your member preferences forms, available to access by clicking this button in your member profile page:

![Preferences Icon](../../../Icons/Preference.png)

The forms are split into individual categories to make it easy for you to find and modify the preferences that you want. We know that form-filling can be boring, but we strongly encourage members to take the time to express their preferences, as this will allow us to tailor your Bondage Club experience to better suit your needs and kinks.

In this section, we will cover each of the preference categories in detail, and give you an overview of how each preference will affect your club experience.

* Cover each of the preference screens, and fully describe what each of the preferences do in each screen
