## Introduction

Thanks to the increasing ubiquity of portable technology, high-tech bondage gear has become more practical to build. 3-d printing, powerful smartphones, and high-quality materials all allow high-tech products to be affordable for the ordinary clubgoer.

This book will walk you through the basics of the futuristic bondage gear available in the club.

## [Basic Features]

### [Bluetooth Communication]

All futuristic items can be controlled remotely using the K-Corp app on your phone. It doesn't matter whether your sub is bound tightly in layers of latex, you don't have to physically reach the controls in order to interface with it.

### [User Lockout]

All K-Corp products have a lockout feature. When the device is locked according to a specific setting ("Exclusive," "Owner," "Password," etc), it will prevent other users from modifying its settings. This way you can ensure that your sub is totally helpless. K-Corp also sells a special type of collar which has the ability to allow others to modify the item settings (see the catalog below).

### [K-Corp Mesh]

K-Corp products are lined with a patented mesh formula that is soft and comfortable to wear, completely moisture-proof, yet also impervious to cutting and grinding attempts. Embedded with steel and ceramic fiber, the mesh will dull any blade it comes into contact with, and the embedded ceramic is known to fracture angle-grinder blades and redirect waterjets. Club maids are given access to a master code that allows them to take these items off without resorting to drastic measures, but the products also have a hardcore setting which can only be set by the wearer-to-be.

## [Advanced Features]

### [Automatic Punishment]

Gear with the automatic punishment ability (namely the Futuristic Panel Gag and Automatic Shock Collar) possess the following modes:
* Low Sensitivity: Punishes the wearer for speaking too loudly (Typing in all caps or using exclamation points)
* Medium Sensitivity: Punishes the wearer for speaking too loudly, as well as speaking for an extended period of time (25 letters)
* Maximum Sensitivity: Punishes the player for speaking at all

### [Password Feature]

When fitted with a Password or a Combination lock, futuristic items can be unlocked by typing in the password or combination in the login screen that shows when a user is normally locked out.

### [High-Tech Offerings]

#### [Futuristic Collar]

The K-Corp collar is packed with features to make controlling access to your sub easier. It possesses the following advanced features:
* Ability to lock various types of locks onto the player's futuristic items
* Ability to allow players who can't unlock futuristic items to be able to change the settings
* Ability to copy colors to other futuristic items worn

#### [Futuristic Panel Gag]

The K-Corp advanced gag features an extending mouthpiece made of medical-grade silicone; Once inflated, the gag is almost as tough as a regular ball-gag, and much more effective at silencing the wearer. It possesses several kinky features, including:
* Adjustable gag length. Can allow the sub to speak normally, or extend deep into the throat for extra punishment!
* Timer feature for more nuanced punishment
* Automatic punishment feature, which allows owners to punish their subs for yelling, talking too much, or even just talking at all; their freedom is at your fingertips.

#### [Futuristic Chastity Set]

K-Corp sells a futuristic chastity belt and bra designed for high-tech slavery. The bra provides precise health information streamed directly to the K-Corp app, while the belt allows owners several degrees of control for shocking unruly subs:
* Can shock the wearer for attempting to tamper with the crotch region
* Can shock the wearer for attempting to struggle out of her restraints
* Can shock the wearer for having an orgasm without permission

### [Restraint Devices]

#### [Futuristic Muzzle]
A steel muzzle for those who want to keep it simple. Contains breathing vents for safety purposes and interfaces neatly with the K-Corp advanced gag.
#### [Futuristic Mittens]
A set of gloves made of K-Corp ultra-secure mesh, with the ability to automatically compress the user's hands into fists and keep them that way; a must-have for owners who love to keep their subs helpless yet mobile.
#### [Futuristic Cuffs]
A full set of hardened steel cuffs with electronic locks, designed to fit snugly yet comfortably. The cuffs can snap together using a patented magnetic technology, which allows owners to easily pin their sub's hands behind their back by simply pulling their arms close together. A hidden fastener clip seals the cuffs together once the sub's limbs are firmly locked in place.
#### [Futuristic Armbinder]
A monoglove made of K-Corp ultra-secure mesh and reinforced with flexible steel flat-links. Once your sub is locked in this, there is no escape without your consent. Contains a self-tightening feature to make self-bondage possible as well.
#### [Futuristic Heels]
A set of metal shoes with retractable heels; you can use these to punish your slave or wear as a fashion statement.

### [Accessories]

#### [Interactive Visor]
An augmented-reality headset with optional locking feature; can be dimmed to varying levels of brightness, for dual-use as a blindfold!

#### [Futuristic Harness]
A self-tightening harness, perfect for that locked-in feeling, or simply to go as an accessory with a costume.
